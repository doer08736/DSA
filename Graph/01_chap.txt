Graph theory: is the the mathematical theory of the properties and application of graph (networks)
example: social network of friends, making combination of clothes to wear

Types of graphs:
1. undirected graph: the edges have no direction and can be traversed in both directions
(is graph in which edges have no orientation)

2. directed/digraph: is graph in which edges have orientation
(edges in directed graph have a direction and can only be traversed in the direction specified by the arrow)

3. weighted graph: in which edges have some numerical values called weight, associated with it
(the weight represent an arbitrary value such as cost, distance, quantity, etc)
(come in directed and undirected)

4. special graph: (tree)
tree: undirected graph with no cycles
it is connected graph wiht N nodes and N-1 edges

5. DAGs (directed acyclic graphs):
directed graphs with no cycles
(play imp role in representing structures with dependencies)

6. Bipartite graph: is one whose vertices can be split into two independent groups U, V such that every
edge connects betweens U and V 

7. complete graph: where there is a unique edge between every pair of nodes
a complete graph with n vertices is denoted as the graph Kn

Representation of graph:
1. adjacency matrix
2. adjacency list
