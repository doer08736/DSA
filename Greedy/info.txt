greedy algorithm:
-constructs a solution to the problem by always making a choice that looks the best at the moment
-works by making locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimal solution

feasible solutions:
-solutions that are satisfying the condition given in the problem

optimal solution:
-solution which already feasible and also giving the minimum cost/best result (there can be only one optimal solution)

optimization problem:
-problem which requires either minimum or maximum result
